Carbonates are strongly linked to the biological world and therefore allow paleoenvironmental reconstructions. 

## Carbonate Formation

Carbonates are produced in carbonate factories. They may be produced by floating lifeforms and then dropped into deeper waters (Pelagic Carbonate Factory) or by sessile organisms on a shallow seafloor (Benthic Carbonate Factory, [[Shelf#Riffe]]). The grains produced are called sceletal grains.

Non Sceletal Grains can also be produced chemically ([[Oolithe]]).

Most carbonate forming organisms prefer normal marine salinity, some tolerate fresh water while hypersaline environments are avoided.

## Deposition

Zones with mainly benthic carbonate deposition are called Neritic Zones, Zones with higher planctonic/pelagic input oceanic.

Large Carbonate Rock Bodies or areas of production are called Platforms. Platforms may be rimmed (bordered by "Walls", that shelter it form strong waves), open (but still flat) or inclined. Attached Platforms are called shelf, detached Platforms Banks.

Deposition occurs across all Latitudes, although concentrated across Tropical and Temperate Areas.

## Diagenesis

### Micrite Envelopes

A sceletal grain is bored into by microbes, these icrobes die and leave tiny holes which are then filled by micritic cement. After many repetitions a micritica envelope is created, replacing the outermost areas of the shell.

### Burial

Physical compaction mainly removes micropores in micrite, whereas the scaletal grains remain unchanged. This leads to a relative increase of the sceletal volume over time. 

Chemically, compaction may also lead to pressure dissolution of grains, leaving behing very jagged borders and solution seams. The remains or scars of this pressure dissolution are called stylolites.
