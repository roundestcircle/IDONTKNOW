#Geo #Exogenes 

Lakes cover about 1% of Land globally, but are negligeable when it comes to their Volume.
They may appear in many different tectonic systems, such as volcanoes, rifts, orogenies etc.

### Varves

Lakes are experiencing seasonal cycles ([[Standgew√§sser]]), while also experiencing very low turbulence/mixing (they are low energy environments). This can lead to very clear, very thin, alternating light and dark layers. 1 Layer is equal to one season (summer or winter). Layer thicknesses can be below 1mm, especially for the winte layer.
