Alluvial systems are related to running water, but not necessarily a river. Its a more general term than [[Fluviale Systeme]].

### Alluvial Fan

An Alluvial Fan is created when a confined flow reaches the end of a valley, looses velocity and drops lots of sediments. They fine outwards, as the finer particles are carried out further. The deposits still remain largely unsorted conglomerates. 
The flow does not follow a consistent bed, instead it changes constantly, creating a fan shape. The Fan can be quite broad, but is often narrow in reality.
