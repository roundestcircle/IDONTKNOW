## Bedforms

Bedforms develop at the interface of fluid and sediment bed. They mostly refer ot the surface structure of the Sediment.

## Sedimentary Structures

Preserved Bedforms and other sedimentary features. refer to the whole 3D-Structure, not only the surface. Bedforms and Sedimentary Structures have different Nomenclatures! Sedimentary structures contain information about Paleoflows, General Depositional Environment, Paleogeographic and Plaeoclimatic information.

### Layering

Laminae are less than 1cm thick, Strata more than 1cm. Strata are sometimes called beds.
If Laminae or Strata ar inclined compared to the layer plane, the structure is called cross-lamination or cross-stratification. Layers can be arranged hierachically: A Cross Stratum, a set of cross strata (layer), a coset of cross strata (multiple layers of similar startification). In certain cases, a layer is laid down in one single event.

### Grading

Strata and Laminae can be massive/homogenous or graded. Graded Beds are always deposited in one single event, which might have only lasted hours. If the Energy increased during deposition/the event, the Beds are inversely graded: The Grain size increases towards the top. If the grain size decreases towards the top, the beds are normal graded. The flow Velocity decreased during the event.

Borders between layers are often very sharp and represent an erosional surface.

If Sediments change size systematically over multiple beds, Its called fining or coarsening up.

## Environment and Corresponding Structures

### Oscillatory Flow

Oscillatory flows occur mainly due to waves.

#### Bedforms

Symmetrical ripple. The constant back and forth of the flow creates back and forth sediment movements that lead to near symmetrical ripples. Ripples consist of troughs and crests.

#### Sedimentary Structure

Symmetrical ripples leave symmetrical cross laminations in two directions. 

![[Schema Symetrical Ripples.png]]

They may also produce Hummocky (HCS, convex-up lamina) or Swaley Cross Stratification (SCS, concave-up lamina), which are thought to e the result of storms, but not quite understod, since the layers are too thick to be explained by modern storms, even though they are very common in the rock record. HCS and SCS are commonly found together. They are truncated, meaning old laminae are cut by new laminae.

![[Schema HCS and SCS.png]]

### Unidirectional Flow

Unidirectional Flow may be created by wind, currents, tides, etc. The type of Bedform is dependent on the Flow Velocity ([[Transport und Sedimentation#Fluid Flow Fundamentals]]). As a rule of thumb, the size of the bedform increases with flow velocity, exceptions apply for supercritical flow. 

#### Bedforms and Sedimentary structures

![[Beform Stability Diagram.png]]

This Diagram is simplified and does not include all Parameters. Notice how the same flow Velocity can lead to different Bedforms depending on grain size. This may lead to Bedforms changing on a sorted surface, such as a beach.
Dunes and Ripples have a less steep stoss slope, that is eroded, and a steeper lee slope, that experiences deposition. They are therefore asymmetrical.

The Shape is created by particles moving uphill on the stoss slope, then falling down as the flow right behind the ripple crest (like windshadow) is much weaker.

In General: Erosional Surfaces are not or barely preserved in the rock record! Therefore, all crosslaminations visible are impressions of lee Side Deposition. Unidirectional Flow is easily discernible as their sed structures are just layers of crosslaminations in the same direction (preserved depositional edge). It is not easily discernible if dunes or ripples are created by water or wind. The particles are maybe smaller in windcreated shapes. Sometimes it is necessary to look for other indicators, such as marine fossils.

##### Ripples

Ripples are asymmetrical and relatively small, a few centimeters high and wavelengths of 10 to 20 cm. Ripples migrate downstream constantly. They do not interact with the water surface. Ripples have different shapes, but the lee edge is always donstream, no matter the crest path.

![[Schema Asymmetrical Ripples.png]]

![[Schema Types of asymmetrical ripples.png]]

There are combinations of oscillatory and unidrectional ripples. 

![[Schema Wave- and Currentripples.png]]

If the Sedimentation rates are very high, ripples tend to climb upwards in the direction of flow (imagine the ripples migrating with flow while the whole bed keeps rising). The higher the deposition rates, the steeper the climb. If the deposition rates are extremely high, deposition might even outweigh erosion on the stoss edge, leading to some stoss edge preservation. These ripples are called climbing ripples.

![[Schema Climbing Ripples.png]]

If the flow velocity changes significantly, for example in tidal environments, the bedding might be heterolithic, meaning interbedded sand and mud layers. The Sand layers show typical ripple-cross-bedding, whereas the mud doesnt.

![[Schema Heterolithic Bedding.png]]

##### Lower Plane Bed

The lower plane bed is a flat bedform, the sediment can barely move. It leads to plane parallel laminations.

##### Dunes

Dunes are similar to ripples, except much bigger. They may reach meters in height and wavelenghts of 100s of meters. The smallest ones are barely above ripple size. Secondary dunes on larger dunes are possible. Dunes are very common on the seafloor and on river beds.

Surface waves are out of sync with the dunes.

2D-Dunes (straight crests) create simple planar cross stratifications. Their Lee-Edges are more or less straight. 3D-Dunes create more complex patterns of of tangential or trough cross stratifications. The layers are more likely lenses than whole layers, the lee edges slightly convex.

##### Upper Plane Bed

The Flow is erasing the previous Bedforms, because its too fast. The sedimentary structures are hard to discern from lower plane bed, since they are also plane parallel laminations.

##### Antidunes

Antidunes develop only in supercritical flows, often experiencing hydraulic jumps. They are the only Bedform that directly interacts with the water surface (Remember: Supercritical Flow means low flow depths ([[Transport und Sedimentation#Froude Number]])). They are in sync, meaning the highest point on the antidune ist also the highest point of the water surface. Antidunes migrate upstream as opposed to all other structures, meaning the preserved depositional edge is oriented opposite to the usual orientation. It is not easy to tell if crosslaminations were created by dunes or antidunes, but antidunes are exceedingly much rarer and sometimes lower angle.

##### Bedform transitions

Bedforms can transition between one another as the flow velocity or the grain size changes.

## Post-Depositional Structures

### Erosional Structures

For Example eroded surfaces, river channels, cut banks.

#### Gutter Casts

Gutter casts are downward bulging sole structures created by vortices. They often appear in HCS and are later filled with new sediments.

![[Schema Guter Casts.png]]

#### Sole Marks

Scour Marks or flute casts are created when larger grains are deposited on mud layers by turbidite flows, eroding the mud layers in specific shapes. The flute casts are later filled in by coarser material. They allow for precise paleocurrent determination.

![[Schema Scour Marks.png]]

Tool marks are created when pieces in the flow are dragged, rolled or bounced across the bottom of a flow. They usually do not allow paleoflow reconstruction, as to movement directions are often possible (cant tell if tool rolled forwards or backwards along its mark).

### Load Casts

Load casts occur when a denser layer sinks into a less dense layer. If mud moves up into the new layer due to the pressure, the casts look like flames. In extreme cases, the sinking parts of heavier sediment might get detached from the main mass and form separarted nodules, sometimes called ball and pillow. These structures are quite small. 

![[Schema Load Casts.png]]

### Soft Sediment Deformation

Soft Sediment Deformation occurs when semiconsolidated block of sediments moves, for example during a slide and gets folded up. The layers below remain undisturbed, Layers above are deposited later, also undisturbed.

### Fluid Escape Structures

Fluid Escape structures form, when fluids are forced out of a sediment. They look like a reverse funnel, leading from bottom to top, concentrating the liquid flow towards the top. Sediments/Layers may also move/curve upwards. 

### Surface Exposure

- Mud/Desiccation Cracks: Formed as muddy sediment dries and contracts. subaerial.
- Syneresis Cracks: Forrmed by clay in response to different salinity levels. subaquatic.
Syneresis Cracks do not form complete Polyons like mudcracks, but rather star shaped indents. In cross section, they are very chaotic and look like worms.
- Raindrops
- Prints

## Bioturbations

The science of bioturbations is called ichnology. These Trace Fossils are named after their shape, not the animal or plant that created them, since the same shape can be created by multiple different organisms. They may be crawling, grazing, resting, dwelling or feeding traces/structures. Bioturbation may also move the oxidational environment further into the sediment, leading to different Weathering Processes.

The amount of Bioturbation can be indexed. Values range from absent bioturbation to complete bioturbation.

Bioturbation creates information about the environment, while it destroys other information by mixing up layering etc.

### Trace Fossil Assemblages

Trace Fossil Assemblages are common combinations of fossils that allow precise determination of depositional environments.

An example of an Assemblage would be Skolithos, containing the Skolithos trace fossil and many others. Skolithos are simple straight downward tubes. The Assemblage represents high energy environments, which dont allow for animal life on the surface, for example wavy coasts. Skolithos today may be created by multiple different mollusks for example.

## Paleocurrent reconstruction

Sedimentary Structures and Bedforms often allow for paleocurrent reconstruction as described above. To be more precise, multiple Paleocurrent measurments are taken on Ripples or casts and plotted in a rose diagram.
