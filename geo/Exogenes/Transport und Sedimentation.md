### Source to sink

Source to sink refers to the entire sediment routing system, from Erosion,through different transport processes to the final deposition (sink).

# Transport

## Fluid Flow Fundamentals

### Density

The larger the density difference of fluid and transported particle, the shorter the transport distance. This means that particles are tranported the shortest in air, longer in water, and even longer in denser, muddy water.

### Viscosity

The more viscous a fluid, the longer the transport distance (ice>Water). The more viscous a liquid, the lower the turbulence. 

### Flow Types

Which flow type occurs, is discernible with the Reynolds-Number. Is it below 2000, the flow is laminar, is it above 4000, the flow is turbulent. 

$R_e = UL/v = UL\mu / p$

U is the Flow velocity, L the depth. The higher those two parameters, the higher the Reynolds-Number. v is the kinetic viscosity, which is the density over the the dynamic viscosity. The reynolds number is therefore lower, the higher the kinetic viscosity. 

#### Laminar Flow

Straight Streamlines, no crossing. Possible only at high velocities and low speeds. The surface is smooth. Rough beds immediately disturb waterflow and destroy the laminar flow. No Mixing. Mainly theoretical.

#### Turbulent Flow

Intertwined Streamlines, much more common than laminar flow. Erosion is increased settlement of particles decreased compared to laminar flow. The surface is rough. Creation of vortices.

#### Froude Number

$Fr = \frac{U}{\sqrt{gL}}$

The higher U, the higher the Froude Number. g ist the gravitational acceleration. L is the Flow depth, the higher the flow depth, the lower the Froude Number.

Subcritical Flows are dominated by gravitational Forces, the Fr is less than one. they are slow and stable. They have high thickness and lower speed.

Supercritical Flows are dominated by Inertia. Their Fr is more than 1. They are characterized as rapid and unstable. They have lower thickness and higher speed.

At a hydraulic jump, the thickness increases rapidly and the speed of the flow decreases. The Flow changes from Supercritical to subcritical.

## Particle Transport Fundamentals

Erosion and Entertainment is dependent on grain size, bed roughness, cohesion of smaller grains and Flow velocity. For a basic overview, the experimentally derived Hjulström-Diagram may be used. Pay attention t the log scales on Both Axis.

![[Hjulström Diagram.png]]

A more precise Diagram is the Shields Diagram, that incorporates more parameters.
The X-Axis is the Grain Reynolds Number (not equal to flow reynolds number!), the Y-Axis the Bed Shear stress.

Three main transport mechanisms:
1. Dissolved Load
2. Suspended Load: Small and light enough to be carried in supension. Often reliant on turbuent flow/eddy currents
3. Bedload: Transport along the river bed, mainly sand and gravel

# Deposition

## Subsidence

Subsidence is a sinking or settling of the earths surface due to the weight of the sediment infill. Subsidence leads to an angle increase of the layers towards the bottom of the Sediments, since the Center of the Sediment depresses further.

## Accomodation

Accomodation is the space available for potential sediment accumulation.

## Sedimentary Basin

Sedimentary Basins are Large scale depressions of the crust, where subsidence has occurred and a thick body of sediments has been accumulated.  Especially important sedimentary basins are the shalow waters next to Riverdeltas. They sometimes accumulate Sediment-Thicknesses of over 15km. The Ganges-Delta is the most important of them. The large thickness allows for Compaction and Cementation which necessitate high pressures and sometimes Temperatures.
