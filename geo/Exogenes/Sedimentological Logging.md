May be done from outcrop or core.

1. Record all sedimentological Information bed by bed (Grain Sizes, [[Sedimentary Structures]] etc.).
2. Represent it in a vertical column, vertical scale being thickness, horizontal scale grain size. Boundaries between beds may be represented by straight or wavy lines, depending on the surface being erosional or not. Sedimentary structures get signs inside the Blocks in the colums.

3. Grouping Beds into Facies ([[Sedimentology Basics#Sedimentary Facies]]), if they have the same characteristics. Facies may be coloured different colours.
4. Facies are grouped into recognizable Facies associations. These associations can be recognized across different logs.
5. Facies and Facies associations are used to create a simplified depositional model
