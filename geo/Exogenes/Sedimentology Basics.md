### Definition and Purpose

Sedimentology is concerned  with the physical and chemical Properties of sediments and sedimentary rocks. It investigates the processes involved in their formation. The Objective is to reconstruct paleogeographic environments and conditions. This is necessary to create pictures of earths history.

Sedimentology is important, since sedimentary rocks are great building materials and have been used for ages (Flint tools, Pyramids from Sandstone). Sedimentary rocks also contain important ressources such as Gold, Salts, Metal Ores and are Reservoirs or fluid paths for important fluids such as hydrocarbons and water. This is important for mining, hydrothermal and groundwater management.

Using Sedimentological Knowledge can also help in Urban Planning and catastrophe prevention such as hangslides, erosion and flooding.

### Methods

#### Analyzing organism remains and fossils

#### 3D-Modelling

Lidar

#### [[Sedimentological Logging]]
Measurement and description of each bed in an outcrop in detail. Building of a sedimentological column. Following the layers uphill, might involve climbing.

#### Core Logging

Similar to the field technique but using drillcores instead of an outcrop. 

#### Geophysical Analysis

Geophysical data such as seimic data allows an indirect interpretation of the subsurface without drilling. 

#### Remote Sensing

Mainly used for recent sedimentation, not Paleogeographic analysis. Involves Satellite or drone images. 

#### [[Korngrößenanalyse mittels dry-sieving]]

#### Flume experiments

Recreating currents in the lab to supplement field data.

#### Computer Simulations

Reconstruct sedimentological fetures under simplified environments. Simulations can take a long time, since they are quite complex.

### Sedimentary Facies

Sedimentary facies are bodies of sediment with distintive Properties, that can be attributed to a specific depositional environment.

### Main types of rock

1. [[Evaporite]]
2. Biochemical Sediments ([[Diatomit]], [[Bioklastkalksteine]])
3. [[Siliziklastika]]

These Systems/Rocks can be mixed.

#### Fundamental Constituents

1. Grains
2. [[Matrix]]
3. [[Zement]]
4. Pores or Porosity

When the grains touch, the rock is called grain supported, otherwise its matrix supported.
