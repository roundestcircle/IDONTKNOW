Gruppe:: Überblick

Siliziklastika sind klassische [[Transport und Sedimentation|Sedimentgesteine]] aus Körnern und [[Zement]] oder [[Matrix]], oder beidem. Oft sind die Gesteine geschichtet. Sie spiegeln in den Schichten Wechsel der Ablagerungsbedingungen wieder, zum Beispiel in Korngrößenunterschieden.

## Texture

The combination of grain size, shape, type and layering/grain orientation are referred to as texture of the rock.

### Ordnung nach Korngrößen

Ähnlich wie Einordnung bei [[Pyroklastika]]

| Korngrößen   | Lockersediment       | Gestein                                       |
| ------------ | -------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| <0.002mm     | Ton                  | [[Pelite]] (Tonstein), Mudstone if not layered, Shale if layered.                         |
| 0.002-0.63mm | Silt                 | Pelit (Siltstein)                             |
| 0.063-2mm    | Sand                 | Sandstein                                     |
| >2mm         | Kies, Blöcke, Steine | runde Komp: Konglomerat, eckige Komp: Brekzie |

Aside from the mm scale, der also exist a phi scale, which is the reverse log base 2 of the mm scale. Therefore Phi 0 means 1mm, Phi -1 2mm, phi -8 256mm (Boulders), phi 2 0.25mm and so on.

Einzelne größere Körner werden nicht beachtet.

Since most rocks are not well sorted enough to pe put firmly  in a category with just this table, a ternary Diagram may be used.

### Sorting

Sorting refers to the uniformity of grains. The more uniform they are in size, the better the sorting. In principle, sorting gets better, the longer the transport distance, but the source also plays an important role. For example, a rock of very similar grains is eroded: the product is immediately well sorted.

### Grain Shape

Grain Shape has to components

1. Sphericity of the grains, meaning how close they are to a circle, mainly determined by the sediment source. Some Minerals just are less spherical than others. Shapes may be spherical, cylindrical, tabular or others.
2. Grain Angularity, ranging from very angular to well rounded. Angularity reduces with transport distance. It is a direct measure of the abrasion of the particles. This means Breccias were transported less than Conglomerates.

### Textural Maturity

Combination of the factors above to determine transport amount:

1. Low Maturity:
- Poor Sorting
- High Mud content
- Angular
2. High Maturity:
- Better Sorting
- Low Mud content
- More Rounded

### Fabric

Fabric refers to the Mutual Orientation of particles. Elongated particles often exhibit a preferred orientation connected to te paleoflow direction. An example is Imbrication, which describes consistent overlaps of elongated particles, like a run of dominoes.

Another important Fabric is [[Sedimentary Structures#Grading]].

Compare also [[Sedimentology Basics#Fundamental Constituents]], Matrix or cement content is another important part of fabric.

### Compositional Maturity

Compositional Maturity is usually linked to textural Maturity since both are controlled by transport distance. It refers to the composition of a sandstone. An immature sandstone contains many different Minerals, some of which may be unstable, such as mica and feldspar. A mature sandstone is dominated by quartz. 

### Maturity Overview

Maturity is a function of Energy in a system, transport distance from source and exposure to weathering ([[Verwitterung]]).

## Sandsteine

Geordnet nach Bestandteilen

1. [[Quarzsandstein]]/Quarzarenite, hauptsächlich Quarzkörner und Zement
2. [[Arkose]], Quarz- und Feldspatkörner
3. [[Grauwacke]] Quarz- und Feldspatkörner, mind. 15%, max 75% Matrix aus [[Tonminerale]]n, Chlorit und Glimmern
4. Litharenite, significant amounts of other rock fragments, usually still contains quartz and feldspar

Bei Matrixanteilen von über 75% spricht man von Peliten. Wacken liegen sozusagen zwischen Sandsteinen und Peliten.

## Clastic vs Siliciclastic vs terrigenous

All three names are quite similar and often used interchangeably. We mainly use clastic.

Clastic: Composed of Fragments of pre existing rock tranported some way.

Siliciclastic: Fragments primarily of silicate Minerals

Terrigenous: Detrital fragments of pre existing rock
